# React Introduction - Gmail

In this exercise, you are going to recreate the layout of [gmail](./images/gmail-email-view-intro.png) and practice breaking down apps into components.

This is a great opportunity to work with a partner, it _could_ look something like this:

- Discuss your approach to the task for 15 minutes
- Work on the exercise separately
- Have a retrospective session at the end of the day and share your learnings

## Prequisites

1. Clone this repository onto your local machines
2. In the root directory, type `npm install`
3. Finally, type `npm run start`

## Instructions

All the source files you need are in the [src](./src) subdirectory.

- Break down `App.js` into components
- Break down `app.css` into stylesheets
- Import the relevant stylesheets for each component

## Tips

- You might find that breaking down sections of code using components isn't possible at this time, that's ok. Take these observations into the next few days.

## Challenge

- Add a component for writing emails below the `email-actions` buttons. For an example, take a look at this [image](./images/write-email-component.png).
